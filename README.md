This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock - Paper - Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for game logic and interactivity.
The player chooses between rock (👊), paper (✋), or scissors (✌️), while the computer randomly selects its own choice.
The result (You Win!, You Lose!, or It's a Tie!) is displayed on the screen, along with both choices and the updated score for the player and the computer.
